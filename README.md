Project Description

This is a personal project that enables the navigation and execution of programs and games from a mobile Android device to an Amstrad CPC 464 computer, using an M4 board connected to the computer. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to remotely manage and run files, facilitating seamless interaction between the devices.

Collaborations and Credits

The project has benefited from valuable contributions from the community. Specifically, the images used have been generously donated by MiguelSky from the Amstrad.es forum, adding a unique visual touch that complements the functionality of the project. Furthermore, the credits for the M4 board, as well as the connections and commands used to operate it, go to Duke (author of the repository on GitHub: M4Duke).

License and Usage

This project is free to use and modify, provided that it remains non-profit. It is also essential to give proper credit to the individuals who made it possible. The purpose of this initiative is to promote learning and creativity within the Amstrad and M4 board user community.
